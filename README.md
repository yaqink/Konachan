## Usage
![Konachan](/Konachan.jpg)

    Download pictures are saved to ~/Downloads/

When download complete, the `Page Number` will automatically plus one.

I suggest to keep `Page Size` under `15`(In order to avoid `Reqest time out` take place >_<)

Name | Explain
--- | ---
Page Size | the number of images you want to download
Page Number | the number of paginate
Tag | the tags of you want to get

Above picture is:

I want to download `50` images taged `loli` and page number at `1`

If you want to download page number at `2`,Just change to

Page Size `50`

Page Number `2`

Tag `loli`
